=====================Tasks=====================
/m - Run the migrations in the script directory (/sd)
    that is passed in. They run inside a transaction,
    so they can be rolled back.  If you want to avoid
    running in a transaction, use the /nt flag.

/d - Creates a script that contains all the commands
    that would be run on the database.  This is used for
    deploying to servers where its hard to run the 
    migration tool to apply changes.  You NEED to pass 
    in the location of the file you want the changes to
    be put in after the /d flag.
    
    Ex. /d c:\my_db_changes.sql /sd <locationOfScripts>
    
/sql - Runs a single sql file against the database.
    It expects the file name after /sql flag. You
    can use the /nt flag to avoid wrapping the command
    within a transaction.
    
    Ex. /sql create_database.sql
