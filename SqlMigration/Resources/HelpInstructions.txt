/m - Run the migrations in the script directory
    that is passed in. They run inside a transaction,

    running in a transaction, use the /nt flag.

/d - Create a folder with all the neccessary files
    to update the database.  Also pushes out a copy
    of the tool to run from the local directory.

    transaction.
    
/t - Include test data.

/date - The date and time you want the migrations to 
    start. This is only processed on the /d task.
